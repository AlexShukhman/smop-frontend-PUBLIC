complaints of infringement, obscenity or defamation or to otherwise review or edit such

## Payments

You understand that neither we, the Task sponsors nor their parent corporations,
subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, assigns, etc. or any entity connected with a Task will
be responsible for any costs (including, without limitation, any federal, state or local taxes)
Coder may incur in connection with any Task or any payment Coder may be
awarded. However, Coder understands that Smop may make withholdings from any
payment that Coder may be awarded in order to comply with applicable tax laws.
Coder agrees to sign any applicable forms necessary to distribute the payment as required
by tax authorities.

All cash payments are listed and shall be awarded in USD. All payments will be awarded in each
Task, provided a qualified number of Submissions are received and the requisite
number of Coders participate in a round of a Task. A Task sponsor may 
award payments to more than one Submission with respect to any Task. If a Coder
cannot or will not accept a payment, then the payment will be forfeited and may be awarded to the
next highest scoring Submission. Unless otherwise provided herein, by participating in a
Task, a Coder acknowledges and agrees that if his/her Submission is selected
as a winner, the Coder will receive a cash payment only upon verification of all applicable
eligibility requirements. Cash payments will be paid out by Smop (or its designee) in the US in
US dollars no later than 90 days following the conclusion of the Task. Taxes, if any,
are the sole responsibility of the winner(s). Payments which remain unclaimed or undeliverable
for a period of six (6) months will be forfeited.

As a condition of winning and redeeming a cash payment, Coders may be required to
submit a completed (i) Coder Questionnaire and all post Task surveys, (ii) if
requested, an Affidavit of Eligibility and Liability and Publicity Release, unless a notarized
copy is already on file with Smop (iii) IRS Form W-9 or W-8BEN, as appropriate if one is not
already on file with Smop, and (iv) a Smop Task Assignment Agreement, if one is
not already on file with Smop. In completing any requested Affidavit of Eligibility and Liability
and Publicity Release, a Coder who wins a cash payment (a) confirms his/her eligibility, (b)
represents and warrants that he/she has not cheated, (c) verifies the accuracy of the
demographic information submitted to, and contained in, the Smop member database, (d)
authorizes Smop to publicize the results of the Task, (e) agrees to sign any
applicable forms required by tax authorities, (f) grants Smop a license to all information
submitted during the Task, and (g) releases Smop from liability arising out of any
payment won. Smop requires all Coders to complete the Form W-9 or W-8BEN for tax
reporting purposes. Providing false information in the registration process or in the required
forms described in this paragraph will result in a forfeiture of a cash payment. If a winning
Coder (i) does not reply to a notification from Smop or the notification is undeliverable,
or (ii) is not otherwise in compliance with these Rules or the rules of a Task, the
Coder will be disqualified and forfeit any payment, and Smop may, at our discretion, select
and notify another Coder. Participatory payments and non-cash payments, when provided, will
be mailed within one month following the conclusion of the Task to the address
provided by the Coder in their Smop profile. Unclaimed or undeliverable participatory
payments will be forfeited. Coders who do not submit the required information by the
applicable deadlines forfeit their payments. Please allow 6-12 weeks for delivery. If a
Coder’s payment is returned, Smop will resend that payment to a secondary address provided
a request is made by the paymentwinning Coder. Smop is not responsible for lost or stolen
items and will not send additional payments in the event a payment is not received.
